debdelta (0.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * some packages (notably, linux kernels) modify files that they install
    , and then patching from installed debs always fails; to avoid, I added
    /etc/debdelta/debdelta.conf , ~/.debdelta/debdelta.conf to configure
    which original files to skip/ship in debian packages
  * add support for bzip2 compression on data.tar

debdelta (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * If "python-apt" is missing, print a error message and exit;

  * debdeltas: 'Package' files may be used as arguments
  * debdeltas : can have multiple --alt  options
  * option --delta-algo to try different binary encoders;
    thanks to "Jiří Paleček" (Closes: #435159).

debdelta (0.16) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * debdelta_upgrade
    - is faster (particularly on small debs - by avoiding calls to dpkg)
    - avoids downloading deltas if not enough disk space for applying them
    - identifies itself as User-Agent =  'Debian debdelta-upgrade'
  * md5 generation and verification may be disabled by option  --no-md5
  * now temporary directories are of the form  ${TMPDIR}/debdeltaXXXXXX
  * better checking for exceptions

 -- A Mennucc1 <mennucc1@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Jul 2006 22:15:51 +0200

debdelta (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * debdelta : 
     - faster on .debs with many many files ;
     - better behaviour when 'out of disk space'  errors occour 
  * debdeltas: 
     - added  '--alt DIR' option, to say where older versions of .debs are
     - added   --clean-alt and --clean-deltas options 
  * debdelta-upgrade: 
     - if a delta fails, download the .deb
     - sources are in /etc/debdelta/sources.conf or ~/.debdelta/sources.conf
  * corrected many bugs

debdelta (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * debdelta_upgrade: thanks to Michael Vogt, now uses APT caches at best
  * debdelta & debpatch: many improvements
      - divide data.tar in small chunks
      - always use bsdiff (xdelta is buggy)
      - gunzip .gz files in data.tar before delta, and gzip after
      (the delta of debhelper  5.0.35  -> 5.0.36 was 80% of original .deb
      before, now it is  to 10%)

 -- A Mennucc1 <mennucc1@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Jun 2006 20:03:16 +0200

debdelta (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * debdeltas: deltas failed due to not enough disk space will be retried
  * debdelta: better use of MD5; and a filename similarity matcher,
      when in computing difference of data.tar.gz (unfortunately, slower)
      also, solves a bug
  + debdelta_upgrade: properly quote URLs (before, it seemed as if 
     a lot of deltas were not present in the archives!); 
     better HTTP handling

 -- A Mennucc1 <mennucc1@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 18:45:17 +0200

debdelta (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * debdelta: (by faking 2nd part of tar headers), some improvement for  .deb
     with many small files
  * debdelta-upgrade : while the thread is patching, also download some
     .debs for which deltas are not available.

debdelta (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * debdeltas: 
    '-n N' option, to decide how many deltas to compute for each package ;

  * debdelta : corrected bug, now really skip conf files !
  * debdeltas : corrected bug, was not exiting from forks !
