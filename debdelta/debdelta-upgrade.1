.TH DEBDELTA-UPGRADE "1" "aug 2009" "debdelta-upgrade" "User Commands"

.SH NAME

debdelta-upgrade \- Downloads all deltas that may be used to 'apt-get
upgrade', and apply them. 

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B debdelta-upgrade
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIPACKAGE\fR] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION

This program is designed to download changes (deltas) that may be used to 
.B apt-get upgrade
all listed packages, and apply them.
If no package is listed in the command line, then it will apply to all upgradable packages. See
.BR debdelta (1)
for more details on the delta files.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-\-dir \fIDIR
directory where to save results.
(default: /var/cache/apt/archives for root, 
/tmp/archive for non-root users)
.TP
\fB\-\-deb\-policy \fIPOLICY
policy to decide which debs to download,
it is a comma separated list of (abbreviations of)
    source =  there is no /etc/debdelta/sources.conf line
    big =  the delta is too big
    error =  the delta fails to apply
    unavailable = all other cases
    after = continue downloading debs after patching has ended
  default is s,b,e
.TP
\fB\-v
verbose (can be added multiple times).
.TP
\fB\-d
print full traceback on Python errors; save useful info in temporary files 
in case that a delta fails; do not print download progress in stderr.
.TP
\fB\-k
keep temporary files (use for debugging).
.TP
.B \-A \--accept-unsigned
accept unsigned deltas.
.TP
.BI \--gpg-home 
specify a different home for GnuPG,
default for root is
.I /etc/debdelta/gnupg
while for other users is unset. See 
.I --homedir
in 
.BR gpg(1)
for details.

.SH EXAMPLES

When invoked as root,
.I apt-get update && debdelta-upgrade && apt-get upgrade
will download delta files, recreate the needed Debian 
packages, and then upgrade your Debian host. When only
slow Internet connection is available, the above procedure may
be significantly faster than "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade".
(Use -v to see how much faster.)

.SH SECURITY

A Debian package that is recreated using
.I debbdelta-upgrade
is byte-by-byte
identical to the original one; when  "apt-get upgrade"
is subsequently invoked, the cryptographic
archive authentication support (see 
.I apt-secure (8)
) will guarantee that it can be trusted to be installed.  Moreover,
the delta files themselves are cryptograhically protected using GnuPG,
MD5 and SHA1 (using the same method as
.BR dpkg-sig (1)
), and 
.I debdelta-upgrade
will refuse to apply corrupted or unsigned deltas (but, see option
.B -A
).
