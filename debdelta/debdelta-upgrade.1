.TH DEBDELTA-UPGRADE "1" "april 2007" "debdelta-upgrade" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
debdelta-upgrade \- Downloads all deltas that may be used to 'apt-get
upgrade', and apply them. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B debdelta-upgrade
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is designed to download changes (deltas) that may be used to 
.B apt-get upgrade
, and apply them. See
.BR debdelta (1)
for more details on the delta files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-dir \fIDIR\fR     directory where to save results.
       (default: /var/cache/apt/archives for root, 
	/tmp/archive for non-root users)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR            verbose (can be added multiple times).
.TP
\fB\-d\fR            add extra debugging checks.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR            keep temporary files (use for debugging).
.SH EXAMPLES
When invoked as root,
.I apt-get update && debdelta-upgrade && apt-get upgrade
will download delta files, recreate the needed Debian 
packages, and then upgrade your Debian host. When only
slow Internet connection is available, the above procedure may
be significantly faster than "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade".
.SH SECURITY
A Debian package that is recreated using debbdelta-upgrade is byte-by-byte
identical to the original one; when  "apt-get upgrade"
is subsequently invoked, the cryptographic
archive authentication support (see 
.BR apt-secure (8)
) will guarantee that it can be trusted to be installed. Currently,
though, the delta file itself is not cryptograhically protected.
