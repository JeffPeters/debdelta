.SH DESCRIPTION

This program is designed to apply a patch (PATCHIN) to a Debian
package (FROMFILE) and create the Debian package (TOFILE).
If the Debian package (FROMFILE) was installed in the host
system and the .deb file is not available, then the argument
(FROMFILE) may be  substituted by the keyword / : then debpatch will
get the needed data from the host filesystem.
