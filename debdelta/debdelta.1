.SH NAME 
debdelta \- compute changes between Debian packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B debdelta 
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIFROMFILE\fR \fITOFILE\fR \fIPATCHOUT 
.SH DESCRIPTION

This program computes changes between Debian packages FROMFILE and
TOFILE. These changes are stored in the file PATCHOUT.  The PATCHOUT
file may later be used by the "debpatch" program to recreate TOFILE
from FROMFILE. In a sense, the pair of programs "debdelta"/"debpatch"
operate on Debian packages similar to how the pair "diff"/"patch"
operate on text files; indeed, the output of "debdelta" may be used to
store and transmit only the changes between Debian packages; but,
contrary to the "diff" output, the output of "debdelta" is not human
readable, but rather it is intended to be as small as possible (to
optimize for less disk usage and/or faster transmission).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-md5\fR      do not include MD5 info in debdelta.
.TP
\fB\-\-needsold\fR    create a patch that can only be used if the old .deb is available.
.TP
\fB\-\-delta-algo\fR \fIALGO\fR 
use a specific backend for computing
binary diffs; possible values are: xdelta xdelta-bzip xdelta3 bsdiff
.TP
\fB\-M \fIMb\fR         maximum memory  to use (for 'bsdiff' or 'xdelta').
.TP
\fB\-v\fR            verbose (can be added multiple times).
.TP
\fB\-d\fR            add extra debugging checks.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR            keep temporary files (use for debugging).
.SH SECURITY
A Debian package that is recreated using debpatch is byte-by-byte
identical to the original one; so the cryptographic
archive authentication support for APT (see 
.BR apt-secure (8)
) may be used to assert that it can be trusted to be installed. Currently,
though, the delta file itself is not cryptograhically protected.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
The command
.br
debdelta  libglib2.0-doc_2.12.11-3_all.deb libglib2.0-doc_2.12.4-2_all.deb /tmp/glib.debdelta
.br 
will express the difference between to versions of libglib2.0-doc
in /tmp/glib.debdelta ; the command
.br
debpatch -v /tmp/glib.debdelta libglib2.0-doc_2.12.11-3_all.deb /tmp/glib.deb
.br
will create in /tmp/glib.deb a perfect copy of libglib2.0-doc_2.12.4-2_all.deb.
